```javascript
// In your main app.js file, you have this code:
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
      <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This code *appears* correct, but it might not work as expected if you have other CSS rules conflicting with Tailwind's classes.  Also, there's no error message, so the problem is subtle.
