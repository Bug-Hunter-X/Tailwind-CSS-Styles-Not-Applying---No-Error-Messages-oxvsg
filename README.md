# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying - Debugging a Subtle Issue

The bug is likely due to a combination of factors, such as CSS specificity conflicts, incorrect class names, or missing configurations.  This example focuses on a scenario where the issue isn't immediately obvious from error messages.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

You'll observe that the background color of the div isn't red, even though `bg-red-500` class is used. 

## Solution
