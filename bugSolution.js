```javascript
// In your main app.js file (bugSolution.js):
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css';
import './globals.css'; // Add this line to import global styles

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
      <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

```css
/* globals.css */
/* Add any global styles that might be conflicting here.  
   For demonstration, I'm adding a very specific rule that might override Tailwind */
 div {
    background-color: lightblue !important; /* This line is simulating a conflict */
 }
```

**Explanation:**  The problem is solved by inspecting the CSS for conflicts. In this simplified example, the `globals.css`  file simulates a CSS rule with high specificity that overrides Tailwind's styles. Removing or adjusting `globals.css` or adding `!important` to the Tailwind classes resolves the conflict. This is just one way a conflict could appear.  More thorough debugging is often required to resolve this.
